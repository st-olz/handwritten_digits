# Building A Handwritten Digits Classifier

In this Project, we'll explore the effectiveness of deep, feedforward neural networks at classifying images.

Scikit-learn contains a number of datasets pre-loaded with the library, within the namespace of sklearn.datasets. The load_digits() function returns a copy of the hand-written digits dataset from UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits).

The procedure is described in the attached notebook [handwritten_digits.ipynb](/handwritten_digits.ipynb).
